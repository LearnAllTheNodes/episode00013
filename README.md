If youâ€™re willing to trust the input that you get from users, then I have a bridge in Brooklyn you might be interested in buying.

In seriousness, we need to make sure that our users are supplying us valid input.  One way of validating that input is to have our data objects define what is and isn't valid data.  This is the approach that frameworks like Ruby on Rails (or more specifically ActiveRecord), and Mongoose provides the same capabilities.  We'll look at using Mongoose's built-in validators as well as how to use our own custom ones.

We'll even get to see a little gotcha, because there's always a gotcha.
